# Brief History and Progression of HTML Versions

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) has come a long way since its inception in the early 1990s. Conceived by Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN, HTML was initially designed to facilitate sharing and linking documents across the internet. Here's a look at how HTML evolved over time:

## HTML 1.0 (1993)
- The very first version of HTML
- Laid down the groundwork for basic webpage structure
- Included text formatting, simple lists, and links
- Minimal, supporting only a handful of tags
- Allowed developers to link and structure simple documents

## HTML 2.0 (1995)
- The first official HTML specification
- Expanded the language's capabilities
- Standardized features like tables, forms, and basic web controls
- Made it possible to create more interactive and user-focused pages
- Became the foundation for the web's growth and the development of e-commerce and interactive content


## HTML 3.2 (1997)
- Introduced important enhancements
- Added support for complex tables, applets, and rudimentary styling with font tags
- Responded to the demand for a more visually engaging web
- Addressed the increasing use of multimedia and web graphics


## HTML 4.01 (1999)
- Added better support for multimedia and scripting
- Improved form controls
- Emphasized accessibility and internationalization
- Introduced the concept of document type declarations (<!DOCTYPE>)
- Standardized content display across browsers
- Marked the beginning of "separation of concerns"
- Encouraged use of CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity

## XHTML (2000)
- Reworking of HTML in XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
- Enforced stricter rules like proper closing of tags and lowercase element names
- Aimed to improve reliability across different platforms
- Intended to make HTML more compatible with XML

## HTML5 (2014)
- The most significant update in decades
- Modernized HTML with new semantic elements (<header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>)
- Introduced built-in multimedia support (audio and video)
- Added new APIs (Canvas for graphics, Web Storage, Geolocation)
- Made it easier to create responsive and interactive content without plugins like Flash
- Set the stage for modern, mobile-friendly web design
